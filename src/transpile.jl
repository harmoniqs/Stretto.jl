    to_native(circuit::GateCircuit, device::AbstractDevice) -> GateCircuit

Rewrite `circuit` so every `GateOp` uses a gate in `native_gate_set(device)`.
Pure circuit rewriting; preserves the overall unitary up to a known sequence.

Supported decompositions (v0.4):
- `:CNOT(c, t)` → `[:H(t), :CZ(c, t), :H(t)]`      (when CZ ∈ native, CNOT ∉ native)
- `:CX(c, t)`   → same as CNOT (alias already handled by resolve_gate)
- Pass-through for any gate already in `native_gate_set(device)`.

Throws `ArgumentError` for gates that cannot be rewritten with the rules above.
